# Four-in-a-row---game

Simple non-GUI program to play 4 in a row game. 

Rules of game are simple:
Itâ€™s always played with 2 players. Each turn each player puts a piece of his color (number 1, 2 in program) inside a column and it will fall until it reaches the lowest available spot. The one who can put 4 pieces of the same color in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins. If no one manages to do it then the match ends in a draw.
